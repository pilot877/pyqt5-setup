# pyqt5-setup
pyqt5-setup creates a simple new pyqt5 program in the current directory. It is intended to allow developers to quickly create a new pyqt5 project without having to create the individual files.

## Is the code terrible?
Yes, yes it is, but this is my first real Rust project, and it's small so I don't really care how it looks, just so long as it functions ^-^
